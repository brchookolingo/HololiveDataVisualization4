Data visualization showing which Hololive members collaborate the most. Data was pulled from Youtube 2021-04-11.

Interactive Version (Allows you to hover over different names to get the specific values!): https://confident-pare-2afeb0.netlify.app/

Why:
This is just a fun project that I though people might find intresting. It's just me playing around try to improve my coding skills.

Data Caveats:
Does not capture any unarchived or members-only content.
Does not capture unofficial collaborations; basically the video description has to have the other channel linked for the code to identify that a collaboration occured.
Collaborations are calculated at the Channel level; so if Ina did a collab with Kiara but only Kiara streamed, then Kiara's collab count would increase but not Ina's. I'm hoping to fix the inaccuracy by expanding the dataset to reflect collab pairs.

Coming Soon:
I want to do a network relationship mapping and maybe create a cool looking network visuzlization where members get grouped based on how much they collab.
I might also try doing a top 3 list where it's an image showing each members top 3 collab partners.
